	<p>Welcome to the Nihongo Bento website.</p><p>This website contains all the resources and content you'll need to get started on and continue learning Japanese. From beginning, and beyond. 
	</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>It is said that the Japanese language is one of the most difficult language to learn. And I get it. Three different scripts, seemingly alien grammar and syntax, so much nuance... but I'm going ahead of myself. But the point is that it doesn't have to be this way. Japanese can be as easy as 1, 2, 3, but only with the right mindset and enough persistance.</p>
	<p>But to swiftly get you started on navigating this 100% free course, it will be split into 4 chapters:</p>
	<h3>Chapter List</h3>
	<li><b>Act 0: The Beginning Stage</b></li><li><b>Act 1: The Fundamental Stage</b></li><li><b>Act 2: The Monolingual Transition</b></li><li><b>Act 3: The Point of No Return</b></li>
	
<h3>Chapter Description</h3>
<p>Well, why are they called "acts"? Ha, it's just me sounding fancy. Anywho, Act 0 will explain how the language-learning process works, and will cover topics such as memorization techniques and language acquisition. Act 1 will cover basic Japanese language content, such as hiragana and katakana, and will also get you started on learning grammar. Act 2 will explain how to escape the bilingual minset (L1->Japanese) into a monolingual one (Japanese->Japanese). Act 3 will cover some advanced topics that no beginner should worry about early on.</p>
